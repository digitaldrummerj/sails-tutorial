## Running Tutorial Locally

If you would like to run this tutorial locally, you need to have node 6.x or greater installed and the npm package gulp-cli installed globally.

Start by running `npm install` to install this templateâ€™s dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And then run `gulp` to launch the guide in your browser:

```
$ gulp
```

Gulp starts up a development server and launches the quick start guide in it. Gulp also watches for changes to files in the `src` folder (including the chapter Markdown files), and refreshes the site in your browser automatically.
